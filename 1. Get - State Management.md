# State Management using Get

Get uses the concept of *Controllers* to manage state. The controllers can be globally accessed within the app.

### Creating a controller

```dart
class Controller extends GetxController {
    var count = 0.obs;
    void increment() => count++;
}
```

You can create a controller by extending the GetxController class. You can create a listenable variable by adding the .obs extension to any variable. Changing the value of that variable (count in this case) updates the UI accordingly.

### Accessing the state

```dart
/// Instantiate your class using Get.put() to make it available for all "child" routes there.
final Controller controller = Get.put(Controller());

/// Simple State Access
Obx(() => Text(controller.count.toString()));

/// Reactive State Access
GetBuilder<Controller>(
    builder: (_) => Text('${controller.count}'),
);
```

In Get, there are two ways of accessing state. One, which rebuilds the UI when the state changes, and another where the UI is only updated when the update() function in the controller is called.

When you want to make simple changes in the UI, like a value changing, use the Obx way. But if you want to do some processing on the state before changing the UI, use the GetBuilder method.
